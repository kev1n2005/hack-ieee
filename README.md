# SoundSense
This project simulates an ESP32-based system that reads sound levels and activates LEDs and a buzzer based on thresholds.
## Functions
- Detects and classifies ambient sounds using analog sound levels.
- Gives real-time feedback via LEDs , buzzer, and OLED display.
- Sends smartphone alerts (via IFTTT Webhook) on detecting critical sounds (like alarms).
- Aims to enhance safety and smart automation using low-cost sensors.
## Hardware Used
- Microphone Sensor(analog)
- ESP32
- RGB LEDs
- Buzzer
- OLED Display
